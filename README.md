# My_first_practice
Taking baby steps

I started my data science journey with an internship organized by Hamoye.
This is my very first practice and attempt at data science and visualizations 
Using jupyter notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn libraries
I was able to achieve all of these
Enjoy!
